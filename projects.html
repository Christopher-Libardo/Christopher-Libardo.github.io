 <p>  I was learning some Photoshop tools through YouTube videos and online tutorials.
	 During a study break, my friend Jerome and I were talking about how Time Magazine made everyone the person of the year in 2005.
	 So for practice I asked him if I can use a professional photo of him for a custom designed Time Magazine cover. He really liked the idea and 
	 was very satisfied from the result of my custom design. Overall, he allowed me to use the custom Time Magazine cover below to present my Photoshop skills. </p>
