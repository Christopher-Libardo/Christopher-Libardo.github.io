  <h1> Blog One: Learning How To Play Billiards  </h1>
  </div>
  
  <div class = "text zoomIn animated"> 
  <p> Two years ago I got into playing Billiards competitively. It all started from watching Efren Reyes' pool matches. Efren's style of play is mesmerizing because as the World's best billiards player he makes the impossible shots look easy. Reyes' 
  creativity and accuracy are amazing. Accuracy, strategy, creativity are my favourite components in Billiards. <br> </br>
  
  From my experience, it takes a lot of time to learn how to perfectly execute position plays while applying the proper English (spins) to make the cue ball move in position for the next shot. 
  The best way to improve in the game is playing against highly skilled players. For instance, when I was playing a match with my friend (pool league player) he taught me a few techniques that are beneficial such as bridge form and planning my shots. 
  His advice improved my gameplay significantly and made me realize how much time and effort I need to be successful. <br> </br>
  
  Therefore, I practice every week with a few friends at a local pool hall and play some 8 and 9 ball. As a result, I still have a lot to learn about implementing English on shots, 
  planning out my shots, and practicing common shots. I am currently in the process of joining an 8 ball league and I look forward into playing competitively. </p>
