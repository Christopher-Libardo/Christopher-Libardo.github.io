  <h1> Blog One: Learning How To Play Billiards  </h1>
  </div>
  
  <div class = "text zoomIn animated">
  <p> Two years ago I got into playing Billiards. It all started from watching pool matches of Efren Reyes. Efren's style of play is mesmerizing because as the World's best billiards player he makes the sportfun
	  and entertaining through his accuracy and creativity of using bank and kick shots (hitting cue ball off a rail into an object ball). Reyes'
  style of play influences billiard players today and what helped the game become popular.  The accuracy, strategy,and creativity elements of pool is what got me playing.
  
  From my experience, it takes many hours to learn how to perfectly shoot the cue ball while applying the proper english (spins) to make the cue ball move in a specific target area for the next shot.
  The best way to improve in the game is playing against highly skilled players. For instance, when I was playing a match with my friend (pool league player) he taught me a few techniques
  that are beneficial such as the bridge form and planning shots. His advice improved my gameplay significantly and made me relaize how much time and effort I need
  to be a great billiards player.
  
  Therefore, I practice every week with a few friends at a local pool hall and play some 8 and 9 ball. As a result, I still have a lot to learn with implementing english on the cue ball,
  planning out my shots, and practicing different types of pool strokes such as a curved drawback shot. I look forward into playing 8 ball competitively very soon.   </p>
